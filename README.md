# Invariant Explorer

A tool for visualizing and exploring agent traces.


## Getting Started

To get started, run the following command. Make sure you first install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```bash
./explorer.py
```

To open the Explorer interface go to `http://localhost`

This will automatically launch a local Explorer instance on your machine.

All data will be stored in `./data`. To reset the data, simply delete the `./data` directory.
